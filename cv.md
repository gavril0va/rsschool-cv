### About

I've always been interested in computers, but I was sure that work is not easy and not always interesting. The idea of working in IT never came to mind.
**Now my goal is to work for fun.**
I am a perfectionist and dig deep until the shovel breaks or the earth runs out.
I have no experience with computer science at work, but I want to become part of this "Hogwarts", which is called frontend.
